                            <strong>What is the correct name?</strong> It has changed with the technology. The first issue was printed in 1993 under the masthead "Children’s Software Revue." In April 2005, " & New Media" was added to the title. In 2005, the title was again changed to "Children’s Technology Review," which is the current and formal name.
