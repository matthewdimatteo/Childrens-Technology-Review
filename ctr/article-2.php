                        We're not going to accuse somebody of posting fake ratings. But when a poorly designed app gets 23 five star ratings, things start to look fishy.

                        If you're the publisher and you'd like explain what's going on, or if you've written one of these reviews and can vouch for your rating, please post a reply.
