                <h3>Welcome to Children's Technology Review!</h3>
                <div class = "paragraph-text print-full-width">
                    <p>
                        Since 1993, we’ve worked toward one goal: “to provide complete and objective reviews of children’s interactive media products.” For those who are new to our work, here’s an overview.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <!--<li>
                            Timely. We publish the first week of every quarter. A typical issue of CTR is about 25 pages, and it is sent to subscribers as a PDF. Additionally, a weekly newsletter featuring three noteworthy children’s apps is sent every Wednesday morning. All subscribers are given full access to our <a href = "home.php" title = "Search our review database">online review database</a>.
                        </li>-->
                        <li>
                            Affordable. The cost is $30 for a <a href = "subscribe.php" title = "Read more about subscription details">1 Year Subscription</a>, which includes full access to the <a href = "home.php" title = "Search our review database">online review database</a>. <a href = "subscribe.php" title = "Read more about subscription details">Read more about subscription details</a>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Ethical. There are no ads or gimmicks. You don’t get spam or pinged to sign up for a survey. We don’t automatically renew subscriptions, and we don’t sell or profit from the success or failure of the products we review (e.g., we don’t use affiliate links). And we don’t share subscriber information. <a href = "guidelines.php">Read our thoughts about objectivity</a>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Educational. We’re educators, so we look at these products with the question, “What does a child walk away from the experience with, that he or she didn’t have when first coming to the experience?” We always put the child ahead of the technology; our work is grounded in child development theory and developmentally appropriate practice.
                        </li>
                        <li>Experienced. Our first review was written in 1985, based on research at the High/Scope Educational Research Foundation.</li>
                        <li>
                            A primary source. CTR reviews have informed other media outlets and organizations, including The New York Times, Scholastic Parent & Child, NPR, and Parents Magazine.<!-- We work with two award programs on an ongoing basis: <a href = "kapis.php">The Kids @ Play (KAPi Awards</a>, given each year at CES, and the <a href = "bolognaragazzi.php">Bologna Children’s Book Fair</a> (the BolognaRagazzi Digital Prize) for ebooks.-->
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Searchable. The CTR <a href = "home.php" title = "Search our review database">review database</a> is big (13,000 entries) and easy to search. There are search filters for age, platform, “what it teaches” (by way of reviewer designated tags), and special topics. You can sort by most recent, best rated, and alphabetical order.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Comprehensive. The database has been a personal project that started as a Masters thesis in 1984. See <a href = "article-3.php">10,500 Objective Reviews, At Your Fingertips</a>.<!-- You’ll find reviews days and weeks ahead of other review sites.-->

                        There’s been a recent explosion in commercial children’s digital content, mostly in the form of apps. That’s why you need CTR. I hope you’ll consider joining our family of subscribers with our <a href = "subscribe.php" title = "Read more about subscription details">subscription form</a>. We’ll take good care of you.
                    </p>

                    <p>* While we’ve worked with both the New York Times and Consumers Union on past projects, CTR has no formal association.</p>

                        WHAT DO YOU GET FOR “FREE?” While most of CTR’s content is reserved for paid subscribers, the <a href = "home.php" title = "Search our review database">online review database</a> is fully searchable for all users. We post review excerpts and link to our <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcGRBU9EK7CnV1PbTec3xSQ" target = "_blank" title = "View the CTR YouTube channel">video reviews on YouTube</a>, which are monetized by Google Ads (we don't choose which ads are shown).<!-- We also post a monthly letter (found on page 2 of each issue) that summarizes the latest news and research on children’s interactive media. Each picks up on the theme of the cover, and previews the Editor’s Choice selections (the highest rated products) of the month.-->
