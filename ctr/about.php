                    Children’s Technology Review (CTR) is an independent, subscriber-supported review and curation service designed to help parents, teachers, researchers, publishers, and librarians find children's interactive media products. The core of CTR is the <a href = "home.php" title = "Search 13,000 reviews of children's interactive media">online database of 13,000 product reviews</a>. CTR is sold as a <a href = "subscribe.php" title = "View subscription details">subscription service</a> ($30/year for full database access.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Started in 1993 based on doctoral research, CTR is designed to bring an impartial voice to the review process. Ratings are given by people with a background in education and child development who have no commercial connections to the products being reviewed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The work is supported by “clean” money, namely subscriber fees, publication sales, and <a href = "http://dustormagic.com" target = "_blank" title = "Vist the Dust or Magic website">Dust or Magic</a> conference registrations. No income is derived from sponsorships, selling award seals, or affiliate sales programs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Originally a Master’s project (Survey of Early Childhood Software, Buckleitner, 1984), the underlying <a href = "ratings.php" title = "Read more about our rating method">theoretical framework behind the ratings</a> has remained unchanged over the years. Ratings can be summarized by the guiding questions that a reviewer takes into the evaluation process:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>“What does the child walk away from the experience(s) with that they didn’t have when they first came to the experience(s)?”</li>
                    <li>“How does the experience empower (or dis-empower) a child?”</li>
                    <li>“Does this experience leverage the potential of technology in a way that traditional, non-digital or non-linear experiences cannot?”</li>
                    <li>“How does this product compare with similar products?”</li>
                </ul>
