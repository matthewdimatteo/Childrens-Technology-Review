                <h3>CTR's Generic Rubric: An Attempt to Quantify "Quality"</h3>

                    <p>
                        We believe that a review is the start of a conversation about the quality of any material used with children, and it is important to acknowledge up front that any two people are going to have different definitions of quality.

                        Children’s Technology Review is an ongoing survey of children’s interactive media. The survey is stored in a <a href = "home.php">large database which you can search online.</a> To get a program’s letter grade, percentage, or 1 to 5 star rating, you need to do some simple math; a process that is automated for reviewers who use the CTR internal slider instrument, but is defined in detail below, for replication purposes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Add up the points in each category (always = 1 point, some extent = .5 points, never = 0 points, and N.A. = Not Applicable) and then divide by the number of items in the category. This number can then be converted to your scale of choice — either a percent or 0 to 5 point scale.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When reviewing any interactive product, it is important to match the instrument with the type of software. In other words, you can’t rate a program low in “Educational Value” if it is intended to be a fictional video game. Even the word “Educational” must be defined. Whose definition of education is being used as a standard? What is the educational philosophy that is most valued? Is the product intended for classroom or home use? That’s why the “N.A.” (Not Applicable) option comes in; and reviewers must be trained in the art of using, or not using it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is important to consider when the review was written. A highly rated program in 2003 might be equal to a poorly rated program in the context of current multi-touch screen technology.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        CTR’s instrument was constructed to be used as a general framework. The final grade or number rating is only meaningful if it is taken in the context of the current market at the time the product is being sold.
                    </p>

                        HISTORY<br/>
                        Children’s Technology Review began in 1985 as part of an attempt to survey all children’s interactive media products (See Buckleitner, 1986, A Survey of Early Childhood Software, High/Scope Press).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Originally a Master’s Thesis, the work became part of a doctoral dissertation, and provides core reviews for CTR’s weekly and monthly publications, and other media outlets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The reviews, grades, and ratings are housed in an internal database with 17,000+ commercial products (as of 2021) for approximately 20 platforms (ie: Mac OSX, Windows, iOS, Android, Nintendo, Playstation, Xbox, etc…).

                        <strong>NOTES ON ASSIGNING GRADES OR RATINGS TO COMPLEX INTERACTIVE PRODUCTS</strong><br/>
                        We urge our readers to consider that the process of assigning quantitative ratings to an interactive product is imprecise, and that we review every review as “the start of a conversation.” For those interested in this, see the article <a href = "article-1.php">“What (exactly) is an App?”</a>. This is especially true because the digital code that makes up an interactive product continually evolves (which is why we date our reviews and award seals). In our attempt to be “the least worst review system” the following measures are taken:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Whenever possible (but not in all cases), child testing is conducted.</li>
                        <li>
                            We use a series of rubrics, and every item contains an “NA” option, so the reviewer has the option to not consider a particular item.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            CTR’s theoretical bias, and underlying justification for definitions of “quality” are clearly articulated, and supported by a research base.

                        We’re not going to accuse somebody of posting fake ratings. But when a poorly designed app gets 23 five star ratings, things start to look fishy. If you’re the publisher and you’d like explain what’s going on…

                        We’re always sorry to give any product a less-than-glowing-review, but like a doctor that tells you need to lose a few pounds, our job can’t involve hurt feelings. Will our rating of a product change? Not unless the product does, and that leads our readers to a question we think about a lot. “How can a product earn five stars?”

						I spoke on a panel on the evaluation of interactive media at the Fred Rogers Center, and I referred to this page, from the September 2011 issue of Children’s Technology Review. I issued a strong disclaimer that every theory can find a champion in technology — in other words, one person’s view of quality can (and should) differ from another person’s view. As Jesse Schell (of CMU) reminded the group, measuring quality in an interactive product is like trying to assess beauty….

                        The six categories in the instrument can help you better understand factors that may be related to “quality” in a children’s interactive media product. In brief, the instrument favors software that is easy to use, child controlled, has solid educational content, is engaging and fun and is designed with features that you’d expect to see, and is worth the money given the current state of children’s interactive media publishing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        CTR editors typically recommend programs that receive a 4.2 star rating or better; a product must get at least a 4.4 rating to get an Editor’s Choice seal. You can easily <a href = "home.php?edchoice=1">find these titles on our online database</a>.

                    <h3>PROCEDURE FOR GENERATING A STAR RATING:</h3>
                    <p>
                        We use an automated set of calculated fields to generate the ratings.
                        First count the number of items in the category, then add up the total points. Divide, and multiply by 100 to get the percent. You can divide by .5 to convert the overall percent to the 1 to 5 star rating. Consider also any extra hardware attachments required to get full potential of the programming, e.g., a sound card, CD-ROM, etc.

                        Don’t forget that this form is generic! To use it properly, you have to look at a lot of similarly designed products, and remember that the “NA” field can be a particularly powerful tool to influence the overall score. And there is no substitute for child testing.<!-- Also, see information about how we rate with our Flex Rubric.-->
